My career began with a strong foundation in web development, mastering frontend frameworks like React. I quickly became adept at creating pixel-perfect, high-performance web applications. But my curiosity didn't stop there.

One of the most thrilling chapters of my career has been developing several AI Assistant Chrome extensions. These projects allowed me to blend my frontend expertise with backend proficiency, creating seamless and intelligent user experiences. Leveraging React for dynamic interfaces and Node.js for robust backend services, I crafted extensions that significantly enhanced productivity and user engagement.

I've also successfully migrated multiple Chrome extensions from Manifest V2 to V3, ensuring compliance with the latest standards and improving performance and security.

In addition to Chrome extensions, I've specialized in developing SaaS applications. My focus has been on creating responsive and user-friendly UI/UX designs that ensure a seamless user experience across all devices. Integrating payment systems like Stripe and PayPal has been a key part of my work, enabling secure and efficient transactions for users.
